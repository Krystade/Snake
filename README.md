# Snake
The classic snake game with a twist, made in python using pygame

# To Run
* Make sure that PyGame is installed on your machine. If it is not follow these steps to install it:  https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
* Once PyGame is installed simply download snake.py and run it through the console. (For my machine the command is *py /location/snake.py*)

The difference between this game and classic snake is that there is a view distance in this one. 
The player will only be able to see the food if it is within a certain distance.
When the game ends the player's score will be shown in the console it was run from.
